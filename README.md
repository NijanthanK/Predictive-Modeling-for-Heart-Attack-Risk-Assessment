# Problem Statement 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection and accurate risk assessment are crucial for effective prevention and management. This project aims to develop and evaluate various machine learning models to predict the risk of heart attacks using a comprehensive dataset that includes both objective and subjective features. By leveraging techniques such as data preprocessing, outlier removal, oversampling, and model training, this study seeks to identify the most effective predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in early intervention and personalized preventative strategies, ultimately contributing to the reduction of CVD-related morbidity and mortality.
